Prefix arg means skip the game-in-progress check and start a new
game straight away.

You are queried for additional command-line options (Emacs supplies
\"--mode gtp --quiet\" automatically).  Here is a list of options
that gnugo.el understands and handles specially:

    --boardsize num   Set the board size to use (5--19)
    --color <color>   Choose your color ('black' or 'white')
    --handicap <num>  Set the number of handicap stones (0--9)

If there is already a game in progress you may resume it instead of
starting a new one.  See `gnugo-board-mode' documentation for more info."
